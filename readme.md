# GrailMS
Management System themed and inspired by Fate series


# 1. How to start?
To properly launch GrailMS open "grail.pyw".
In order to create an user, you must pick username and password that are unique and then click "Register". At the moment there's no indication if user was sucessfully created, so after registering click "Login" button and if it launches you're ready to go.

# 2. Commands
- *open [file name]*:
  Opens an editable file(eg.: .txt, .py) in text editor. The file must be in your current path. Current path contents are displayed in list on right side of the window.
- *save [file name]*:
  Saves contents of text editor. The file will be saved as the name your inserted, or it will override an existing file. Again this will happen in your current path    which is displayed in log window.
- *run [application name]*:
  Runs an application. Again again it must be in your current path.
- *ascend [path]*:
  Sets your current path to whatever you insert as long as it exists. For exapmle "ascend Users/Username/Desktop/Images"(it automatically adds "C:/" at the beginning and "/" at the end).
- *goto [path]*:
  Goes forward one folder, chosen by you from current path.
- *back*:
  Goes back one folder in path.
- *refresh*:
  Refreshes file list because it does not update automatically.
- *display [image name]*:
  Opens up an image chosen from current path in external window. Window is the size of chosen image so it might be very big, because current version of GrailMS doesn't optimize it yet.
  
# 3. Overall purpose
GrailMS serves no purpose. This is a program is made purily from my vison. It's rather heavily personalized and made just beacuse. I'll probably add more visual and functional options to customize in the future, but for now I care only about my personal experience with it.
